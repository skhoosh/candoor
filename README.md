Setting up the tigergraph database
1. Sign up for a free tigergraph account at https://tgcloud.io/ if you do not have one.
2. When you are signed in to your tigergraph cloud account, click on the "My Solutions" tab on the left hand side.
3. On the right hand side, click on the blue "Create Solution" button to create a new tigergraph database.
4. We used tigergraph version 3.5.0. This option may not be available, so go ahead and choose the closest version.
5. For the starter kit, choose the blank template and then click next.
6. For the "Instance Settings" page, you may choose your desired cloud platform and preferred region. It is also fine to leave the settings as default, and does not impact performance.
7. For the "Solution Settings" page, set the "Name your Solution" to "candoor", "Set the Initial Password" to "password". You may choose to set your own "Subdomain" name, or leave it blank to let Tigergraph assign one to you.
8. Confirm and submit.
9. Go back to "My Solutions" page, and take a look at your solution. Click on your solution to see the details of your database. Take note of the "Domain" address listed. You will need to use this info later on.
10. Click on the blue box icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12766571/163662227-1d018455-9a98-444b-b5b6-b6de7e3d6101.png)
 of your solution that reads "Solution Operations", and click "Start". It takes a few minutes for tigergraph to set up and run the database. When the database is ready, the "Applications" icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12766571/163662332-0e1e3907-c973-4fca-ab6b-6940d0e8206f.png)
 next to it will turn blue. You may click on the "Applications" icon and "GraphStudio" to see the tigergraph database.
