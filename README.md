## Problem Statement

### The Problem

As humans we naturally need meaningful connections with others to thrive. Social connections impact almost all aspects of our lives, from our happiness and health to our work prospects, prosperity and material well-being [[link]](https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness). However, we only seem to be getting lonelier, with 43% of young adults reporting an increase in loneliness due to the pandemic [[link]](https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/reports/loneliness-in-america). 

Aside from our health and happiness, social isolation or the lack of opportunities to make meaningful connections can also have a negative impact on our job or career prospects. A visualisation provided by Our World in Data showed that in Spain, up to 84% of people relied on contacts to find a job [[link]](https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness) [[link]](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/proportion-of-unemployed-using-friends-relatives-trade-unions-in-job-search?tab=map). Aside from this, not everyone knows how best to advance in their career, or has the privilege or resources to explore their interests. Unfortunately, the issue of privilege and unequal access to resources is not new. Marginalised communities are disproportionately affected. By analysing 50 years of economic data, the Urban Institute found that the poorest got poorer and the richest got much richer [[link]](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/). 

If this problem goes unchecked, we feel that opportunities for social mobility will only decrease, and the income disparity will get wider. We would like everyone to have the opportunity to explore their interests, unleash their full potential, and ultimately live fulfilled lives.

### The Challenge

It is clear from these examples that for the good of society, it would be beneficial to find a way to help foster meaningful relationships between people so that everyone can live life to their fullest potential. We hope to help people foster meaningful connections with each other, by facilitating connections in a safe and mutually beneficial way by connecting aspirants looking to explore a subject, with experts willing to share about the same subject.

Such an arrangement is most akin to a Mentor-Mentee relationship. According to LinkedIn, more than 80% of users want a mentor [[link]](https://www.hiration.com/blog/linkedin-career-advice/) [[link]](https://uxdesign.cc/a-ux-ui-case-study-redesigning-linkedin-mentorship-547001e0c2df). People see the value in learning from others. However, mentorship programs fail because people are intimidated to be a “mentor” as they are afraid of the perceived level of commitment, responsibility and expertise required. 

In reality, we believe that everyone has something they can share about and everyone has something that they want to learn about. Therefore, our aim is to make such interactions informal and flexible, so as to foster candour and openness. A quick question about someone else’s experience is something that can still give valuable insights.

For our project, we want to help facilitate and foster these meaningful relationships and connections between people. 


## Description

Candoor is a social networking site for people who would like to share or connect with others for anything from professional industry advice to tips for pursuing a hobby in a candid and informal way. Users fill out their profiles with what they are able to share about as well as what they want to learn more about. Harnessing the power of TigerGraph, we then perform the best match possible. Join Candoor to help someone by sharing your knowledge. Or come learn something new from someone. Candoor let’s us all expand our horizons.

### Impactfulness

Connecting with others meaningfully is integral to our well-being. As the current director of the long-running Harvard Study of Adult Development said, “loneliness kills” [[link]](https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/). Social connections impact almost all aspects of our lives, from happiness and health to work prospects and material well-being [[link]](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/proportion-of-unemployed-using-friends-relatives-trade-unions-in-job-search?tab=map). 

The lack of an established network is also one of the root causes of systemic socio-economic inequalities. An analysis by the Urban Institute showed that the poorest got poorer while the richest got richer. Between 1963 and 2016, American families near the bottom 10th percentile went from having no wealth to being about $1000 in debt [[link]](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/). 

Social networking sites have millions of users, for example, LinkedIn in 2020 reported 690 million people [[link]](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/). Although making meaningful connections on these sites is not easy, with 80% of people saying that they experience anxiety while reaching out to strangers [[link]](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/), this shows that social networking platforms have the ability to reach out to millions of people . 

Our project aims to address this by helping to facilitate meaningful connections between people. We do this by matching people based on a particular skill or topic. Everyone has something they can share, some knowledge that they have acquired. Everyone also has something we want to learn more about. The platform works by matching those who want to share with those who want to learn. Often, people fit into both categories. Matching with people you can discuss with is a good way to build meaningful connections through the mutual engagement of a specific topic or skill. 
 
### Innovativeness 

Although many social networking sites currently exist that boast millions and up to billions of users (Facebook has 2.9 billion users in 2021 [[link]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,most%20popular%20social%20media%20worldwide.)), the reality is that it is difficult to develop deep connections with people on these sites. Instead, social networking sites have evolved to become more of a personal micro-blogging platform, where users post snippets of their lives and human interaction is consumed in a passive way.

We decided to reframe the idea to come up with a site that actively encourages one-on-one human connections.

With our platform, we made searching for connections more personable and authentic. We invite users to freely express themselves and their passions, and share whatever likes and interests they may have. With this information, we provide a topic-based matching to show users who they may want to connect with. This way, users are not inundated with making searches and do not feel intimidated to connect with others.

To provide the best connection possible, we let users indicate their interest levels towards a subject to make the best match. Through the power of graph databases, we are able to base our matching algorithm on a scoring system that ranks the suitability of matches through checking numerous factors. These include country, gender, friend network, people who have been blocked and interest level. TigerGraph makes this possible through fast information traversal and retrieval, done by storing data directly in the RAM of TigerGraph’s servers, and by compiling and optimising installed database queries.
 
### Ambitiousness

Candoor is an implementable app that, if launched, has the potential to reach anyone with access to the web. Candoor distinguishes itself from existing social media sites and fills a gap in the market. We give everyone the opportunity and grow their network and help them to fulfill their potential. This opens a doorway to the exciting possibility of building a large user base that will, in-turn, push the scale of the graph database. 

Our graph schema has 5 vertices, 9 edges, and we wrote a total of 35 gsql queries that we implemented in our app.

We built out a fully-featured app that has the following features implemented: 
- Sign-up
- Login
- Edit and personalise your profile
- Match with people who want to learn more
- Match with people who want to share more 
- View profiles of other people 
- Add them as friends 
- Delete them as friends
- Block people
- Message people

Our ambitious algorithm aims to find the perfect match through comparing multiple user attributes. Our algorithm match score is based on a weighted hierarchy, and we give a higher importance to your friend network, compared to the matching of individual traits such as gender and country. Just in this MVP alone, we have already made use of 5 traits in our scoring system. Uniquely, in addition to the usual way of matching people through their friend network, we also actively search through their friend’s block list, and reduce the match score of people that their network has blocked. 
 
### Applicability 
We have built a fully usable minimum viable product that only needs to be hosted to be brought live. Although we do plan to add more features and further refine Candoor’s concept before our actual launch, we also plan to make use of iterative testing to gather feedback, understand real world needs and cater towards our users.

One of the many aims of Candoor is to facilitate the making of mentor-mentee connections. In 2017, Linkedin launched Career Advice, a mentorship program [[link]](https://www.fastcompany.com/40438926/linkedin-is-testing-a-new-feature-that-matches-you-with-a-mentor). However, this feature was discontinued in late 2020 as Linkedin decided to invest in other areas [[link]](https://www.risinginnovator.com/2020/11/how-to-find-a-mentor-on-linkedin/#:~:text=Update%3A%20LinkedIn%20discontinued%20its%20Career,find%20a%20mentor%20on%20LinkedIn), leaving a gap in the market . With more than 80% of professionals on LinkedIn wanting a mentor according to LinkedIn’s own study [[link]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-experience-linkedin-career-advice-feature-diena-souare-mshr/), this means a potential market size of at least 648 million people.

Furthermore, Candoor does not require nor promote the need for formal qualifications in order to share or connect. Candoor’s casual and informal approach to making matches is meant to encourage anyone in all industries to engage in the Candoor community. Studies show that LinkedIn has a demographic skewed towards the affluent and educated. According to the Pew Research Center 2021 Social Media Use, over 50% of adults who have a bachelor’s or advanced degree in the US are LinkedIn users, while LinkedIn engages with only 9% of people whose education doesn’t surpass high school [[link]](https://kinsta.com/blog/linkedin-statistics/). Conversely, Candoor is a platform for everyone, meant to connect people from different walks of life to have candid conversations with one another.

#### Making a TigerGraph account and creating a blank TigerGraph database
##### 1. Sign up for a free TigerGraph account 

Sign up for a free TigerGraph account at https://tgcloud.io/ if you do not have one. Log in to your TigerGraph account 

##### 2. Create a new solution 

When you are signed in to your TigerGraph cloud account, click on the "My Solutions" tab on the left-hand side.
On the right-hand side, click on the blue "Create Solution" button to create a new TigerGraph database.

##### 3. Select TigerGraph Version

We used TigerGraph version 3.5.1. This option may not be available, go ahead and choose the closest version.
For the starter kit, choose the blank template (Blank v3.5.1) and then click next.

##### 4. Instance Settings

For the "Instance Settings" page, you may choose your desired cloud platform and preferred region. It is also fine to leave the settings as default and it does not impact performance.

##### 5. Solution Settings  

For the "Solution Settings" page, set the "Name your Solution" to "candoor", "Set the Initial Password" to "password". You may choose to set your own "Subdomain" name or leave it blank to let TigerGraph assign one to you.

##### 6. Confirmation 

Confirm and submit. TigerGraph will set-up your new instance. 

##### 7. Wait for solution to be "Ready" 

Refresh the page. TigerGraph will process your submission and you should see a yellow circle indicating that it's "processing". It will turn green when it's "ready".

##### 8. Get "Domain" address of your solution 

Go back to the "My Solutions" page, and take a look at your solution. Click on the "candoor", the name of your solution, to bring down a tab to see the details of your database. Take note of the "Domain" address listed. You will need to use this info later on in step 10.

##### 9. Check status of solution 
If the Status of your solution is set to a blue circle and "stopped", click on the "Solutions Operations" icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12766571/163662412-58887c92-c81b-4ce1-866e-06665dfb0000.png) of your solution and click "Start". It takes a few minutes for TigerGraph to start-up the solution. 

When the database is ready, circle will turn green, the status will say "ready" and the "Applications" icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12766571/163662332-0e1e3907-c973-4fca-ab6b-6940d0e8206f.png) under "Actions" will turn blue. You may click on the "Applications" icon and "GraphStudio" to see the TigerGraph database.

##### 9. Update the tigergraph_settings.py file

In [tigergraph_settings.py](tigergraph_settings.py), change the variable "hostName" to the domain name you found in step 8. Please keep the "https://" as the first part of the hostName. 

In tigergraph_settings.py, change the variable "hostName" to the domain name you found in step 9. Please keep the "https://" as the first part of the hostName.

#### Setting up the TigerGraph and SQLite database

##### 1. Run [main.py](main.py)
The [main.py](main.py) contains the code for setting up the graph schema, importing data and installing all the TigerGraph queries. It also contains code that sets up the SQLite database that we are using to implement login in our app. 

Run [main.py](main.py) with the command:
`python main.py` 

Please be patient, in our tests, it took us up to an hour for the code to run. TigerGraph is taking the time to install the queries so they can be run super fast later on.

---

#### Running the Candoor app 
##### 1. Navigate to the project directory 
Once the TigerGraph database has been setup, navigate to the project directory with the command: 

`cd .\project\`

##### 2. Run [app.py](app.py)
Run the Candoor flask app with the command: 
`python app.py`

##### 3. Accessing the app 
When the app says it's running, open your browser of choice and head to http://localhost:5000 to access Candoor.

Alternatively, you may be runnong on a different host or port depending on your local set-up. In this case, the correct address will be stated after "wsgi starting up on" in your terminal. Use this address in your browser to access Candoor. 

---

#### Have fun exploring Candoor! 
##### 1. Create a new profile 
You may sign-up with Candoor and create a new profile. 

##### 2. Or use our example account 
Alternatively, you may log on with the following credentials to access a pre-made profile: 
**Email:** audrey@candoor.com
**Password:** password

Please note that we only created a limited number of test profiles, so searching for your preferred aspiration/expertise may not populate any search results. Some suggested searches are "Engineering", "Computer Science" and "Yoga" to match with our dummy accounts. 


## Future Improvements and Known Issues
### Skills Graph 
Our goal is to develop a skills graph in the future. We hope to collect enough inputs from the free-form text inputs of skills users are interested in. Using this information, we hope to build out a skills graph. We envision that this skills graph will categorise skills based multiple levels of classification. For example "Watercolour" and "Sketching" may both be grouped under the parent category of "Visual Art" which can be grouped under a larger category of "Art". Using graph databases, a skills graph could provide further insights into what skills are closely related, so that we may be able to provide users with better suggestions for who to match with. 

### Fine Tune Matching Algorithm
 If we have the chance to launch Candoor, we strive to provide a safe, open and inclusive environment. We plan to fine-tune the matching algorithm by exploring the use of machine learning to further enhance our matches. Additionally, we will provide more avenues for people to reach out to us if they feel harassed or threatened. 
 
### User Interface 
 We will also be iterating on our user interface to ensure that it is intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use. We will be looking into building responsive web pages so that the site also works well on mobile. 

### Login Implementation 
Currently, the login is implemented using SQLite as an intermediary database to handle user-sessions. We would want to implement this using TigerGraph in the future. 


## Reflections

We're excited about Candoor's future :) We took a while to decide on a project that we felt would show the great potential of graph databases bring. We believe that Candoor is that project. With Candoor, we aim to make a difference by:
- Addressing societal disconnect, social inequality and improve social mobility by connecting people 
- Give a personable approach to facilitating connections in a safe and inclusive way 
- Give everyone the opportunity to grow their social networks 
- Create an open community for everyong to have a voice and the freedom to discover themselves 

Candoor is the space for candid conversations~
